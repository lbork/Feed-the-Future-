00:00:10.65
It is also part of our struggle to see that the amenities of life in the 20th Century reach our people. 

00:00:18.08
You know, Mr. President, that we are very very far from achieving the goal of raising those standards of 

00:00:24.56
living without which the struggle for independence is not enough. We are determined to carry on the struggle 

00:00:35.13
and I’m sure with friends in the world, in all parts of the world, we're certain to win that struggle too.

00:00:43.02
For the past 50 years or so we've seen a friendship between the people and the governments of the United States and 

00:00:49.01
Tanzania. 

00:00:50.59
That was certainly the case when Julius Nyere met John F. Kennedy in Washington 50 years ago, and it's the case today. 

00:00:57.33
Every single presidential initiative of the United States Government, be it the President's Malaria Initiative, the 

00:01:03.12
Global Health Initiative, our Climate Change Initiative is active here in Tanzania.

00:01:08.08
In 1961, President John F. Kennedy created the United States Agency for International Development by executive order.

00:01:17.02
The fledgling agency was to be responsible for distributing aid and providing funds for civilian projects in the 

00:01:23.33
developing world. 

00:01:25.96
USAID has been present in Tanzania since its inception. In 1961, USAID implemented their first project in Tanzania,

00:01:35.08
providing seed money and subsequent long-term funding for the Morogoro Agricultural College.

00:01:41.72
Fifty years on, the College, now renamed the Sokoine University of Agriculture, represents a standing tribute to the 

00:01:48.41
long-term collaboration between Tanzania and USAID. Fittingly, the University is host to the Agency's 50th Anniversary 

00:01:57.51
celebration.  

00:02:00.67
Sokoine University of Agriculture is indeed a very important institution, for agricultural development in this country. 

00:02:12.56
This country being an agricultural country, having this institution training young Tanzanians to be able to work more 

00:02:22.82
efficiently in this area of agriculture is indeed a big contribution of USAID to this nation. 

00:02:33.36
USAID is today involved with projects across a range of sectors in Tanzania, including Health, Natural Resource 

00:02:40.28
Management, Education and Food Security. Through close partnership with the Government of Tanzania, these initiatives 

00:02:48.27
aim to help the country achieve its development goals. 

00:02:51.80
USAID and Tanzania enjoy a very special partnership; we've been working here for 50 years with the Tanzanians, primarily

00:03:00.86
in the health sector, dealing with health, HIV/AIDS and, more recently, malaria, in education particularly primary 

00:03:08.05
school, reading, math and science, helping them improve their democratic governance and democratic systems, working with 

00:03:16.51
them...They have a beautiful natural landscape with great game parks and supporting their natural resources management 

00:03:23.08
and wildlife protection and more recently in the agriculture sector; helping them grow their economy through improved 

00:03:31.27
agriculture productivity and markets. 

00:03:35.50
The influence of Sokoine University of Agriculture on Tanzania's economy cannot be underestimated.  Agriculture 

00:03:41.49
contributes to over half of Tanzania's GDP and over 80% of the country’s agricultural manpower is trained through SUA.

00:03:50.31
50 years after receiving the original seed from USAID, Morogoro continues to play a hugely important role in the 

00:03:57.28
country's agricultural development. 

00:04:00.02
Sokoine is the only agricultural university here in Tanzania, and being located in Morogoro which is the heartland of 

00:04:08.57
Tanzania's agricultural land, it has played a very important role in the agricultural development in the country, 

00:04:16.69
particularly in shaping the agricultural policy, but also provide education to smallholder farmers. 

00:04:25.38
SUA is at the heart of USAID's Feed the Future initiative which seeks to improve smallholder farmer income and 

00:04:30.72
nutritional status through agricultural growth and expansion of the food supply. FtF is intended to stimulate a 25% 

00:04:38.05
increase in staple food supplies in five years and a three-fold increase over the 20 year life of the project. 

00:04:46.96
So Sokoine University could play a very important role in contributing to improving food security and also in 

00:04:54.31
alleiviating poverty in rural Tanzania.As you know 70% of Tanzanian people are employed in agriculture and 

00:05:02.53
agriculture contributes immensely to the national economy.  

00:05:12.05
Many of the University's Alumni were funded by USAID throughout their studies. Through investment in people and local 

00:05:18.88
capacity building, USAID provides pathways for sustainable development in Tanzania.

00:05:25.05
Winning that scholarship meant for me to go and study in America, doing my masters in public health at John Hopkins 

00:05:33.41
School of Public Health and then I was able to succeed and finish the program and actually come back to the same 

00:05:39.73
organization here in Tanzania where now I'm at a much higher level. I sit in senior management meetings where actually 

00:05:48.41
the decisions are made which impacts the program.

00:05:52.92
At the launch the university received a further one million dollars, to carry on the economically vital role it plays in

00:05:58.30
Tanzania's development. The Government of Tanzania is a crucial partner in deciding strategy, allocating funds and 

00:06:07.45
physically implementing programs. Through the robust relationship that USAID enjoys with the Government, great strides 

00:06:14.32
have been made over the last 50 years. 

00:06:18.32
The partnership that USAID and the Government of Tanzania has forged for the last 50 years has involved the development 

00:06:24.73
of human resources and building social and economic infrastructure. It's also involved with undertakings with the 

00:06:34.85
potential to alleviate poverty, improve food security, prevent and treat infectious diseases and improve maternal and 

00:06:42.84
child health. Throughout all these big years, USAID has worked diligently in Tanzania in partnership with the 

00:06:51.43
government, civil societies and non-government organisations to bring about positive change in the lives of the people 

00:06:58.63
of Tanzania.

00:07:04.25
Well going forward, really the partnership needs to take Tanzania to the next level. They're one of the notable emerging 

00:07:11.45
democracies in Africa, they're doing very well comparatively to their neighbors in terms of free and fair elections,

00:07:20.36
 transparency and open government, but the institutions are still weak and we need to get the institutions and 

00:07:26.68
partnerships up to the strength they need to be, so that the people of Tanzania will appreciate and sustain this 

00:07:34.02
democracy for offering them the services and the future that they deserve.

00:07:40.56
The Feed the Future project is one of many current programs critical to the continued growth of Tanzania. In conjunction 

00:07:46.55
with health and educational projects, it aims to provide Tanzanians with the skills and capacity to provide enough 

00:07:53.60
nutritious food for the burgeoning population.

00:08:06.52
United States of America has provided an unwavering support to Tanzania's development struggle, even when the economic 

00:08:14.33
policies that we pursued after independence became different from those practiced by the United States of America and 

00:08:22.68
advocated in other parts of the world. This continuous assistance from our American partners attests to the fact that 

00:08:30.81
the United States of America is really a true friend of Tanzania.
