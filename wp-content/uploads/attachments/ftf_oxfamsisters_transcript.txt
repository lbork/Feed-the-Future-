\f0\fs24 \cf0 0:00:00: Feed the Future: The U.S. Government's Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative\
\
0:00:08: Feed the Future caught up with some of Oxfam's Sisters on the Planet Ambassadors as they celebrated International Women's Day 2012. They shared with us their thoughts on global hunger and food security.\
\
0:00:15: Mary Sue Millekin: Food security means that everybody on the planet has enough nourishing food to eat so that they can thrive and contribute. That's not happening now and when we look into the future it could become a bigger problem.\
\
0:00:30: Anna Oloshuro Kalaita: Food is life. Without food there is no life, in families and the nation at large.\
\
0:00:43: Kesha Ram: If you're hungry, you can't be anything else. You can't be a boy or a girl, you can't be thinking about your future, you can't be playing and enjoying your childhood. You're just thinking about where your next meal is going to come from\'85 it's really important that we invest in our future. That every young person has an opportunity to think about what they want to be when they grow up. To have have a family and to just have food security. \
\
0:01:06: Robin Eckstein: For me as a veteran, food security equals national security. There's really no way to pull them apart\'85 When you have instability in regions, it causes it to become a breeding ground for terrorists, whether it's in Iraq or Myanmar or any country, basically. When you have drought, famine and flood these areas becomes insecure. And for me, it's cheaper to buy seeds than it is to buy bullets. \
\
0:01:32: Ram: Particularly women, but everyone needs access to land, resources, skills, rights that will allow them to be food secure--to have what we enjoy, for the most part, here in the United States, which is the ability to ensure that our kids won't go hungry.\
\
0:01:48: Kalaita: It is important to involve women in the fight against food insecurity because they are the main food producers and yet the main victims of food insecurities\'85 I got the award last night because I have championed the fight against food insecurity. This award is recognition and motivation to keep the fight going. \
\
0:02:13: Milliken: I'm very excited about the future and connecting everybody on the planet with enough food to eat. \
