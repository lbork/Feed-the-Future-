Slide: Feed the Future caught up with maternal health advocate and model Christy Turlington Burns at the recent launch of the Womenâ€™s Empowerment in Agriculture Index at the UN Commission on the Status of Women in New York. Christy is founder of Every Mother Counts. She attended the Commission as part of the U.S. delegation. We asked for her thoughts on the importance of advancing opportunities for women and girls worldwide

Off camera: What does it mean to you to be here today and to be experiencing the Commission on the Status of Women and what are you learning? What are your thoughts on the event?

CT: Well, this is a really important event for a maternal health advocate like myself. To be able to participate at a meeting of this high level with such leaders in the global community who are really fighting every day for gender equality and for girls and women to be part of that discourse globally is such an important thing so I?m honored to be here.

Off camera: Where do you hope we?ll see this platform in the next 10, 15, 20 years?

CT: Well it?s been really exciting to see just in the last 5 years or so how girls and women becoming more and more a part of the agenda every year at both the UN General Assembly as well as this meeting?the Commission. You know for me as a fairly new person in this community it?s exciting to see it?s gaining momentum and that everyone is starting to come around the table to recognize the important value of something that as a girl?as a woman?I?ve always recognized. But it?s important that we all have dialogue around these issues and how to make more equality around something that should be recognized.
